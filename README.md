# Entity Framework Performance Demo
Demo project for my Entity Framework Performance talks

This is a demo project that I use for my Entity Framework Performance talks. It demonstrates ten typical performance issues. Every issue is implemented in one of the classes that implement the IDemo interface.

Each class has two methods: One that demonstrates the problem, and one that shows the solution

In order to use run the samples you need access to a SQL Server with the [Northwind Database](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23654 "Follow Link to download Northwind from the Microsoft website")

## Do you need help with your Entity Framework Performance issues?
I do offer consulting services in the performance and memory trouble shooting area! I work both, remote and onsite.
